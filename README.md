💡 Dark Activated LED Project

> This project demonstrates how to control an LED using a photoresistor (LDR).  
> The LED turns **on** when the surrounding light level is low (dark environment),  
> and turns **off** when the light level is high.
> It has been **simulated in TinkerCAD**, **designed in Fritzing**, and **tested in a physical environment**.
